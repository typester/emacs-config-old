* This release requires cedet 1.0beta2 or later. cedet        *
* includes semantic, eieio, speedbar, and senator, all        *
* packages required by the JDEE. You can obtain cedet         *
* at http://cedet.sourceforge.net                             *
*                                                             *
* Please note that your .emacs file must "load" cedet.el,     *
* not "require" cedet. See the installation instructions      *
* that come with the cedet package for more information.      *
*                                                             *
* This release requires version 1.2.2 (or later) of the       *
* JDK.                                                        *
*                                                             *
* This release also requires avltree.el, which is part of the *
* elib 1.0 package. You can obtain elib at the JDE web site   *
* in compressed tar (http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib.tar.gz)      *
* or zip (http://sunsite.dk/jde/elib.zip) format.             *
*                                                             *
* JDEbug runs on Windows 2000 only if Service Pack 2 (or      *
* later) is installed.                                        *
*                                                             *
* If syntax-coloring does not work, download and install      *
* overlay-fix.el from the semantic web site.                  *
*                                                             *
***************************************************************

* Fixes regressions in Documentation->Generate commands 
  caused by inadvertent double quoting of string options,
  e.g., jde-javadoc-gen-doc-title, on Windows.

* Fixes bug in jde-junit-run command that causes a Lisp error
  when the command is executed.

* Changes variables named assoc to assoc-x in the JDEE's Lisp
  code. This is intended to fix a "Symbol's value as variable is void:
  old-assoc" problem when debugging with the compiled version of JDE
  in xemacs/cygwin.

  Thanks to Henry S. Thompson.

* Fixes bug in jde-xref-make-xref-db command.

  Thanks to Jack Klebanoff.

* Updated compile commands to be compatible with new Emacs 
  policy of making compilation buffers read-only.

  Thanks to Martin Schwamberger.

* Update cedet version-checking to recognized prerelease
  designation.

* Emacs 22 compatibility fix: fix max-lisp-eval-depth error caused by 
  change in behavior of expand-file-name that breaks jde-root-dir-p. 

  Thanks to Phillip Lord [Phillip.Lord@newcastle.ac.uk].

* Added support for indenting Java annotations.

  Thanks to Suraj Acharya <sacharya@cs.indiana.edu>.

* Fixed jde-open-class-at-point to handle inner classes.

  Thanks to Suraj Acharya <sacharya@cs.indiana.edu>.

* Fix bug in jde-junit-get-testee-name.

  Thanks to Christophe Garion [garion@supaero.fr]

* Revert jtags script to tagging everthing with one invocation
  of find instead of three to avoid listing each java file three
  times. 

  Thanks to Jon Schewe <jon.schewe@honeywell.com>

* Quote ant.home path if it contains a period. 

  Thanks to Troy Daniels.




JDE 2.3.5

* On XEmacs, Use efc-xemacs-query-options, i.e., a GUI dialog box
  instead of a text dialog box, only if use-dialog-box is nonnil.

* Fixes bug in ProjectClasses to avoid duplicate entries of imports.

* Updated JDEE's Ant interface to force use of pipes to interact
  with external Ant process.

* Fixed regression that caused jde-help-class-member to issue a
  Lisp error.

* Fixed regression in jde-wiz-update-class-list command.

* Fixed regression that caused JDEbug to issue a Lisp error
  when launching an application.

  Thanks to Martin Schwamberger.

* Revise the following templates to conform to CheckStyle
  requirements:

  - jde-gen-deep-clone-template
  - jde-gen-to-string-method-template
  - jde-gen-bean-template

  Thanks to Martin Schwamberger.

* Added the following code generation templates:

  - jde-gen-exception

    Generates an exception class in the current buffer.

  - jde-gen-exception-buffer

    Generates a buffer containing an exception class.

  - jde-gen-hashcode-method

    Generates a hashcode method at point.

  - jde-gen-equals-method

    Generates an equals method at point.

  - jde-gen-tostring-method

    Generates a toString method that uses Apache's
    ToStringBuilder class. 

  Thanks to Ole Arndt.

* Enhanced jde-run-option-classpath to allow you to 
  specify that the JDEE should omit the classpath
  argument when running the class or application in
  the current buffer, regardless of the setting of 
  jde-global-classpath.


* Fixed regression that caused the JDEE to switch 
  projects during debugging when stepping into
  code that does not belong to the project being
  debugged.

* Updated regular expressions used by the JDEE's interface
  to jdb to accommodate non-English punctuation styles 
  for numeric expressions in debugger messages, e.g., 
  1.200 for a line number where the English would
  write 1,200. 

  Thanks to Morten B. Isaksen.

* In previous releases, building javadoc caused
  all future uses of compilation mode to try to
  display the javadoc. This release fixes the problem.
 
  Thanks to David Evers.

* Updated the submit-problem-report command to include
  an XEmacs user's init.el file.
